# MVP Analytics Engineering Workflow

#### 1. **Requirement Gathering and Tracking (Jira)**
- **Objective**: Collect and manage business requirements for data analytics projects.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Create Jira Tickets**: Business stakeholders create Jira tickets detailing the analytics requirements, including the type of analysis, required metrics, data sources, and deadlines.
    2. **Prioritization and Assignment**: Tickets are prioritized based on business needs and assigned to data engineers and analysts.
    3. **Requirement Elaboration**: Analysts work with stakeholders to elaborate on requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of the data needs and expected outcomes.
#### 2. **Data Sourcing (Extract and Load)**
- **Objective**: Extract raw data from various sources and load it into a cloud data warehouse/data lake (Snowflake/Dremio).
- **Steps**:
    1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine the data sources (e.g., CRM, ERP systems, external APIs) required to fulfill the analytics needs.
    2. **Data Extraction**: Use ETL tools (e.g., Fivetran, Stitch) to extract data from these sources.
    3. **Data Loading**: Load the extracted data into Snowflake or Dremio. This involves creating tables or staging areas to store raw data at rest.
#### 3. **Data Transformation (dbt)**
- **Objective**: Transform raw data into a clean, usable format using dbt, leveraging SQL models.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Setup dbt Project**: Initialize a dbt project, configure connections to Snowflake/Dremio, and define the project structure.
    2. **Create SQL Models**: Develop SQL models to transform raw data into desired formats. This includes:
        - **Staging Models**: Basic transformations to clean and standardize raw data.
        - **Intermediate Models**: Aggregations and calculations to prepare data for business logic.
        - **Final Models**: Data models tailored to specific business use cases.
    3. **Testing and Documentation**: Implement tests to ensure data quality and document models for maintainability.
    4. **Run dbt**: Execute dbt commands to run the transformation pipeline, generating materialized views in Snowflake/Dremio.
#### 4. **Data Loading into Materialized Views**
- **Objective**: Load transformed data back into Snowflake/Dremio as materialized views.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Define Materialized Views**: Create materialized views in Snowflake/Dremio based on the final models generated by dbt.
    2. **Ensure Data Quality**: Validate the materialized views to ensure they meet the specific business use cases and data quality standards.
    3. **Automate Updates**: Schedule regular updates of the materialized views to ensure they always reflect the latest data.
#### 5. **Data Visualization (Tableau)**
- **Objective**: Visualize the transformed data to provide actionable insights to business stakeholders.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Connect Tableau to Data Warehouse**: Establish a connection from Tableau to Snowflake/Dremio.
    2. **Create Data Extracts**: If necessary, create extracts of the materialized views for optimized performance in Tableau.
    3. **Develop Dashboards and Reports**: Design and build dashboards and reports that visualize key metrics and insights. This includes:
        - **KPIs and Metrics**: Display critical performance indicators.
        - **Charts and Graphs**: Use various chart types (e.g., bar, line, pie charts) to represent data.
        - **Interactive Filters**: Allow users to filter and drill down into the data.
    4. **Publish and Share**: Publish the dashboards to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, making them accessible to stakeholders.
    5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Collect feedback from stakeholders to iterate and improve the visualizations.
